# Hardware And Operating System

## RAM Requirements

The components that are included in your Cillers Systems Demo Template will affect the hardware requirements for being able to run it on your computer smoothly. With a minimal configuration you will not need much, but if you're building an enterprise-grade system you would need at least 16GB of RAM and more if you want to run your own AI models.

## Processor Requirements

Some processors that are older than around 2015 may have issues.&#x20;

## Operating System Requirements

Cillers runs on the latest versions of macOS, Windows and Linux.&#x20;
