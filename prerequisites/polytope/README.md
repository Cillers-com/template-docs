Cillers System Demo Templates are built on [Polytope](https://www.polytope.com) which provides an amazing developer experience for running and orchestrating all of your services and automation

Polytope is the easiest way to build, run, and iterate on your software. It gives you a unified interface for running all your services and workflows (CI, DataOps, MLOps, DevOps, ...) - on your machine, in the cloud or on-prem.

## Installing Polytope&#x20;

Installing Polytope on macOS and Linux is super simple. Windows is a bit more involved since you need an new version of Windows Subsystem For Linux (WSL2) installed.&#x20;

The installation procedure differs depending on operating system, so we have separate installation instructions for each operating system.&#x20;
